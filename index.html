<h2>Origin Story</h2>
<p>I'm an naturalized immigrant to the US from Trinidad and Tobago. My family got to this country by winning green card lotteries under the Diversity Program offered by the Department of  Immigration services. I joined the USAF in October of that same year as a 4C0 (Mental Health service) and am a 12 year Veteran. I moved to Seattle after I got promoted to civilian status, and have lived in WA state since 2014.</p>

<h3>Super Power</h3>
<p>I'm a really good cook.</p>

<h4>Weakness</h4>
<p>Water I can't stand in.</p>
